WithSelect HOC maps State To Props 
wtihDispatch HOC maps update props to state management

Like React-Redux we use mapStateToProps
const { WithSelect, withDispatch,registerStore, combineReducers } = wp.data;
const { withState } =wp.compose;

let options = {
    actions: {

    },
    selectors: {

    },
    resolvers: {

    }
};

options.reducer = combineReducers({
    
})
